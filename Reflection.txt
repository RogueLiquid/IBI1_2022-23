I have worked to be familiar with git and github.
I didn't understand how git works at first, because I couldn't know the difference between "git add" and "git commit".
Also I learnt(through the internet) how to quit the scene when i run "git commit" without the name of commit.
I created the repository and made my github page with theme Hacker.
